# Rock Vs. Mine Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a given set of sonar data represents a rock or a mine. The prediction is based on certain features using a Logistic Regression model. The notebook for this project, developed in Google Colab, is available for further exploration.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook:** [Rock_Mine_Prediction.ipynb]
  - The primary notebook where data exploration, model development, and evaluation take place.
  
- **Dataset:** [sonar_data.csv]
  - The dataset used for training and testing the Logistic Regression model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Python environment with necessary libraries installed. You can find the required dependencies in the notebook.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git

**Usage**
Open the Rock_Mine_Prediction.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or any compatible notebook viewer.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the data, build the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**
The model has been trained to predict whether the given sonar data represents a rock ('R') or a mine ('M').
Provide insights into the model's performance, key findings, and any additional analysis conducted.
Making Predictions
The provided code allows you to input new sonar data and predict whether it represents a rock or a mine.
python
Copy code
# Example Input Data
input_data = (0.0286, 0.0453, ...)

# Predicting
prediction = model.predict(np.asarray(input_data).reshape(1, -1))

# Displaying the Prediction
if prediction[0] == 'R':
  print("The mineral is Rock")
else: 
  print("The mineral is Mine")
